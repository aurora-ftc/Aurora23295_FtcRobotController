## AURORA 2025 CODE REP0

## New Aurora Coders Start Here!

I recommend you begin by reading through the "Controller24" class. This contains code written by
former team member Kylah from the 2023/2024 Into the Deep Competition. Whether or not you have any
experience with Java, the code is pretty logical and will teach you how to code a basic TeleOp.

You can also read through the code samples from FTC themselves. In this Android Studio Project go
to your project deck on the right and then FtcRobotController > Java >
org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller and
then read through some of the internal/external samples.
